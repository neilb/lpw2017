# Resources for London Perl Workshop 2017

## Sponsor slide

Speakers: please thank the sponsors at some point in your talk.
To facilitate this, we've created a slide that you could put
at the end of your talk.

Put this slide up when you're taking questions.

To get this slide into Google Slides, first download the [.pptx Power Point version](sponsor-slide.pptx)
to your computer. Then go to your Google Drive and upload the file there. 
Next, doubl-click to open it from Drive, which will import it into an empty Slides presentation.
Select and copy the slide with the sponsors, switch to your own presentation and paste the slide there.
